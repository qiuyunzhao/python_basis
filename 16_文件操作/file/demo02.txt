I do not know what that dream is that you have.
I do not care how disappointing it might be as you are working toward that dream.
But that dream that you are holding in your mind  it is possible.
Some of you already know that it is hard. It is not easy.
It is hard changing your life.
In the process of chasing your dreams, you are going to incur a lot of disappointment, a lot of failure, a lot of pain.
我不知道你有什么样的梦。
我也不在乎你在逐梦之时它曾令你有多沮丧。
但我要告诉你，你心中所坚持的那个梦，它是有可能实现的。
你们中有的人应该也已经知道要实现它很难。的确并不容易。
要改变你的人生，这很难。
在逐梦的过程中，你们会遇到各种各样的困难，沮丧，失败，痛苦。
